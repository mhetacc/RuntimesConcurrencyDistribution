> [...] the only way we know to implement a reliable computer system is to use several different "processors" to compute the same result, and then to perform a majority vote on their outputs to obtain a single value. [...] \
This is true whether one is implementing a reliable computer using redundant circuitry to protect against the failure of individual chips, or a ballistic missile defense system using redundant computing sites to protect against the destruction of individual sites by a nuclear attack.

The `xmlrpc.client` and `xmlrpc.server` modules make implementing remote procedure calls into an almost trivial task. Despite the modules’ names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed.
