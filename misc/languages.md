 Most engines are built around the idea of having a core language they're implemented in, and a more flexible scripting language that most gameplay logic is written in. \
The reason this distinction is made is that when you write and compile C++ for most of these engines, Unreal included, you're writing very verbose code ... You're also effectively recompiling the engine every time, which slows down the iteration loop \
when you try to make a game with lots of interacting systems that are going to mutate a lot over the course of development, the overhead of C++ will slow you down.
