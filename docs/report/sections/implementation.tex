\section{Implementation}

We will now discuss the technologies employed in the development the the project (section \ref{sec:python}) as well as presenting our implementation of the algorithm Raft (section \ref{sec:raft}).

\subsection{Python} \label{sec:python}

Python is a high-level, dynamically typed and interpreted programming language that is often used for scripting, data analysis and generally small applications, making it a non-obvious choice for this project, which is nothing of the above. 

That being said, Python has a number of advantages on its side: first of all it is undoubtedly the most popular and widely used programming language in the world, as stated by both TIOBE index and IEEE Spectrum \cite{tiobe} \cite{ieeeSpect}, and secondly it has a huge ecosystem of libraries that implement all the functionalities we need for this project, namely: \textit{xmlrpc} for the remote procedure calls (RPCs), \textit{threading} to handle local concurrency and finally \textit{Pygame} to manage everything game-related.
