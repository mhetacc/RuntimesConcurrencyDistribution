\section{Raftian Node Architecture} \label{sec:raftian}

In the previous section (\ref{sec:raft}), we explained in detail how nodes communicate with each other and handle their log. Now we will explain what actually happens inside a node, {i.e., the architecture of a single node of the application, comprising of both a server and a game instance}. Before showcasing {it}, we will briefly explain how Pygame works, thus taking the opportunity to present the user interface.

\subsection{Pygame} 

Pygame's approach is very straightforward: first comes the declaration and set up of all the graphical components, such as game window, fonts, colors, variables and constants. Every element gets positioned on the main window by coordinates \textit{(x,y)}, where \textit{(0,0)} is the top left corner. Most items are made of two fundamental Pygame classes: \textit{Rect}, which creates non-graphical objects that expose many useful methods, for example to position, move, and resize themselves, or to detect collisions and mouse clicks, and \textit{Surface}, which is the most basic graphical component that has dimensions and can be drawn upon. Often we want to bind, thus constrain, surfaces with rects so that we use the latter for spatial operations. One last fundamental is the \textit{blit} function, a method that draws one image onto another or, to be precise, that draws a source Surface onto the object Surface that calls it. We can give it an optional argument to specify a drawing destination, either with coordinates or a rect. To clarify: $baseSurface.blit(sourceSurface,destination)$ draws \textit{sourceSurface} onto \textit{baseSurface} at the coordinates specified by \textit{destination}. An example of all the above can be seen at listing \ref{code:pygameIntro}.

Pygame, being low-level in nature, is very flexible and allows us to do pretty much whatever we want. For example, we defined our players as dataclasses that encapsulate both the players' data (like \textit{id} or \textit{health points}) and their Rect and Surface objects, as in listing \ref{code:pygamePlayer}.

Finally, Pygame gives us direct access to the game loop, which is implemented as nothing more than a \textit{while loop}. In it, we can process player inputs and refresh the screen, dynamically changing what is displayed. In short, we manage everything that happens while the game is running. In listing \ref{code:pygameLoop} we can see two types of player input, one for quitting the game and a left-mouse click, the latter of which causes a refresh of the header. Specifically, if \textit{Player 2} gets clicked, the header will display \textit{"Player 2 pressed"}, reverting back to its original state after a couple of seconds. The last command, \textit{clock.tick(fps)}, allows us to limit the framerate, effectively slowing down or speeding up the game engine itself by constraining the amount of times per second the game loop repeats itself.

toptext = font.render("Top Text", False, BLACK) # header text

header = pygame.Surface((1000, 100))            # creates surface for header

DISPLAY.blit(toptext, (rect_header.centerx - xoffset, rect_header.centery - yoffset))

\subsection{Raftian User Interface}

Figure \ref{fig:raftianUI} shows different phases of a normal Raftian's game session. Specifically, they demonstrate how the interface changes when the player repeatedly clicks on (thus \textit{attack}) Player 3, the blue one on the top left (players are represented as four coloured squares on the board). Players' colours become progressively desaturated as their health points decrease, by modifying their alpha channels as shown in listing \ref{code:pygamePlayerDamage}. When a player is dead, its colour changes to a darker shade. 

In the header an attack message gets written, reverting back after half a second. Said message changes depending whether the player is still alive; if not, damage is ignored. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language={Python},label={code:pygamePlayerDamage}, caption={Whenever a player gets damaged, its colour gets desaturated}]
for player in players:
    if player.id == order.command and player.hp > 0:
        player.hp -= 30  # apply damage to player:

        if player.hp < 90 and player.hp >= 60:
            player.ui.set_alpha(190)
            DISPLAY.blit(player_UI_cleaner, player.rc)  # clean player UI
            DISPLAY.blit(player.ui, player.rc)          # redraw player UI
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Raftian Node Architecture}

The architecture of a Raftian node can be seen at figure \ref{fig:raftianArch}. Let's explain it: first of all, the game loop and the server are encapsulated in two functions to be handed over to two different threads, enabling concurrent execution (listing \ref{code:startMainThreads}). Whenever a player clicks on (i.e., attacks) one of the four players, the game engine does not apply damage immediately. Instead, it generates a \textit{command} which represent, if we want, the \textit{intention} of attacking said player. This \textit{command} is thus appended to a queue called \textit{pygame\_commands}, one of the two synchronized FIFO queues\footnote{FIFO, or First-In-First-Out, is a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure, often data buffers, where the oldest data inserted is the first that gets processed, making it work in a sense like a pipeline} necessary to allow communication between server and Pygame's threads (listing \ref{code:queues}). Both are instances of Python's standard library queue module\footnote{Python's queue, a synchronized queue class: \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html}}, which implements thread-safe, multi-producer, multi-consumer queues. 

At this point, Pygame does not concern itself anymore with said user input. The server, by itself, periodically checks the \textit{pygame\_commands} queue (as in listing \ref{code:addCommands}) and, when not empty, removes elements from it (as in listing \ref{code:translateCommands}) and propagates them as entries to the leader (or to the whole cluster if said server \textit{is} the leader, as in listing \ref{code:leaderPropagateEntries}).

Then, {the leader propagates the received commands to the whole cluster}, which we will now call \textit{orders}. Each server adds received orders to its own log, as explained in section \ref{sec:logReplication}, so that they can later be appended to the \textit{raft\_orders} queue when entries get applied to state (as in section \ref{sec:applyToState}). This way, the original user input gets propagated back to the server that generated it in the first place.

Finally, Pygame checks (periodically) the \textit{raft\_orders} queue for orders. When it finds them, it removes them from the queue and updates the user interface accordingly (an example can be seen at listing \ref{code:updateUI}).

The whole idea is to keep server and game engine as separated as possible: the former reads commands, propagates them and writes received orders, the latter reads orders, updates the UI, and writes commands, following a unidirectional cyclic communication pattern.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={Python},label={code:startMainThreads}, caption={Start both Pygame and server's threads}]
def handle_pygame():
    pygame.init()
    #...
    While True:
         #...
def handle_server():
    with Raft(...) as server:
        #...
        server.serve_forever()

server_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_server)
server_thread.start()
pygame_thread = threading.Thread(target=handle_pygame)
pygame_thread.start()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language={Python},label={code:queues}, caption={Queues for commands and orders, they allow inter-thread communication}]
# user inputs through Pygame which writes them here
# Raft reads them and propagates them to the cluster
pygame_commands = Queue()

# commands that have been applied to state are written here by Raft
# Pygame reads them and updates UI accordingly 
raft_orders = Queue()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language={Python},label={code:updateUI}, caption={Pygame periodically checks whether there are new orders and updates the UI accordingly}]
while True: # Pygame's main loop
    #...
    while not raft_orders.empty():
        order: Raft.Entry = raft_orders.get()

        for player in players:
            if player.id == order.command and player.hp > 0:
                player.hp -= 30  # apply damage to player:
                #...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Evaluation and Results}

While we did not have enough time to implement evaluation procedures for measuring things like response time or network latency, the game has been thoroughly tested. Responsiveness is good, with no noticeable input latency and a solid framerate way above sixty frames per second (which is still the preferred limit), and both log replication and overwriting functionalities have been confirmed working as intended. The proof of this fact can be observed in the logs at \url{https://github.com/mhetacc/RuntimesConcurrencyDistribution/tree/main/logs}, specifically by comparing logs among folders \textit{bob1}, \textit{bob2}, \textit{bob3}, \textit{bob4}, and \textit{raftian}: all logs (meaning \textit{Raft logs}) contain the same entries, in the same order, between all players.
