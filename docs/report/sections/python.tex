\section{Python} \label{sec:python}

We \textcolor{changes}{are now going to discuss} the technologies employed in the development of the project, as well as presenting our implementation of the Raft's algorithm.

Python is a high-level, dynamically typed and interpreted programming language that is often used for scripting, data analysis and small application development, making it a non-obvious choice for this project, which does not fall into any of these categories.

As a language, it has two main advantages compared to others: first of all it is undoubtedly the most popular and widely used in the world (figure \ref{fig:tiobe}) \cite{tiobe,ieeeSpect}, meaning abundant documentation and resources. Secondly it has a huge ecosystem of libraries that implement all the functionalities we need for this project, namely: \textit{XML-RPC} for the remote procedure calls (RPCs), \textit{threading} to handle local concurrency and \textit{Pygame} to manage everything game-related.

\subsection{Remote Procedure Calls} \label{sec:xmlrpc}

In Raft's specifications it is stated that nodes communicate with each other via remote procedure calls \cite{raft}, which in distributed computing is when a program causes a procedure (or subroutine) to execute in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) calling it as if it were local (that is, the programmer writes the same code whether the subroutine is local or remote).

There are many libraries that implement this functionality, like gRPC (\url{https://grpc.io/}), which is a high performance open source RPC framework used by many big players, such as Netflix \footnote{Netflix Ribbon is an Inter Process Communication library built in software load balancers: \url{https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon}} and Cockroach Labs \footnote{Cockroach Labs is the company behind CockroachDB, a highly resilient distributed database: \url{https://www.cockroachlabs.com/}}, available for many languages (Python included), but we opted for the standard library \textit{XML-RPC} \footnote{XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Call method that uses XML passed via HTTP as a transport: \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.html}} thanks to its promised simplicity and ease of use. 

The library provides both server and client implementations, encapsulating the former in its own loop, while the latter can be fired as needed allowing a bit more flexibility in its usage.

In code \ref{code:client}, \textit{client} is an instance of \textit{ServerProxy}, which acts as the client-side interface for XML-RPC, \textcolor{changes}{allowing it to call} the remote procedure \textit{test\_foo} as if it were a local function, even though it executes on a server in a different networked location.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={Python},label={code:client}, caption={Client as server proxy}]
with xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('http://localhost:8000', allow_none=True) as client:
    print(client.test_foo(42)) # print returned value
\end{lstlisting}

The server must be instantiated and kept running by calling its event loop (e.g., using \textit{serve\_forever}), and all remote procedure calls must be registered using the \textit{register\_function} method of \textit{SimpleXMLRPCServer} (code \ref{code:server}).

\begin{lstlisting}[language={Python},label={code:server}, caption={Server}]
with SimpleXMLRPCServer (('localhost', 8000)) as server:
    def test_foo(number):
        return f'The number is {number}'

    server.register_function(test_foo)  
    server.serve_forever() # keep server alive
\end{lstlisting}

For this project, we extended \textit{SimpleXMLRPCServer} to create a class that implements the Raft protocol \textcolor{changes}{(more details in section \ref{sec:raft}).}

\subsection{Concurrency} \label{sec:threading}

In this project the need for concurrent programming arises from two challenges: every server has an internal timer that fires at certain intervals, and every node has to run a game engine and the server itself at the same time, \textcolor{changes}{both of which are, by design of their own respective libraries, independent, blocking and perpetually executing loops.}

\textcolor{changes}{Some Raft implementations we saw achieve concurrency with asynchronous programming\footnote{Two examples of Raft's implementations that leverage asynchronous programming are Raftos (\url{https://github.com/zhebrak/raftos/tree/master}) and Zatt (\url{https://github.com/simonacca/zatt/tree/master})}, likely to avoid common multithreading issues such as memory leakage}, using libraries such as \textit{asyncio} \footnote{Asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax: \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html}}, which while powerful and efficient, makes writing code a bit awkward and cumbersome. We thus opted for a more traditional approach using multithreaded programming: in computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instruction that can be \textcolor{changes}{scheduled independently} \cite{lamportMultiprocessor}, and multiple threads may be executed concurrently sharing resources such as memory. \textcolor{changes}{This} is directly counterpointed to multiprocessing, where each process has its own storage space, and moreover processes are typically made of threads. \textcolor{changes}{Processes and threads are profoundly different and do not serve the same purpose, but it is useful to cite both of them to provide the context needed to fully understand section \ref{sec:thmpComparison}}.

In Python there are modules in the standard library for both of them, respectively \textit{threading} \footnote{The threading module provides a way to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process: \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html}} and \textit{multiprocessing} \footnote{The multiprocessing module is a package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to the threading module: \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html}}. It is fundamental to note that the former does not provide real multi-threading since, due to the Global Interpreter Lock of CPython (the, for want of a better word, official Python implementation), only one thread can execute bytecode at once. To cite directly from the documentation: \textit{"[GIL is] The mechanism used by the CPython interpreter to assure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. This simplifies the CPython implementation by making the object model (including critical built-in types such as dict) implicitly safe against concurrent access. Locking the entire interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be multi-threaded, at the expense of much of the parallelism afforded by multi-processor machines."} \footnote{Global Interpreter Lock: \url{https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html\#term-global-interpreter-lock}}.

Thankfully, this does not apply with the \textit{multiprocessing} module, which creates separate processes instead, offering both local and remote concurrency effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock, allowing programmers to fully leverage multiple cores. As previously stated, processes are much heavier than threads and thus more expensive to create, but do not incur the risks of shared memory. 

\subsubsection{Comparison}\label{sec:thmpComparison}

To evaluate which of the two modules is more suited for our purposes, we devised a simple experiment: we created two game instances with one hundred and one thousands coloured dots respectively (figure \ref{fig:randomdots}), that move around by offsetting their position each frame of a random amount between minus five and plus five pixels (pseudocode \ref{code:randomdots}).

Then we ran both of them in three scenarios: with the game instance alone (baselines), with a server alive in a thread and with a server alive in a process, and we measured the \textit{frames per second} (FPS) \footnote{Frame rate, most commonly expressed in frames per second or FPS, is typically the frequency (rate) at which consecutive images (frames) are captured or displayed. This definition applies to film and video cameras, computer animation, and motion capture systems, while in the context of computer graphics is the rate at which a system, particularly the graphic card, is able to generate frames. Source: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate}} in each case, since it is the most common metric to evaluate game performance. Higher FPS-count translates to a smoother and more responsive, i.e., better, gaming experience.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={Python},label={code:randomdots}, caption={Pygame graphical dot offset}]
# create random offsets for both x and y coordinates
xmov = random.randint(-5,5)
ymov = random.randint(-5,5)

# move the dot by a certain offset
dot.move_by(xmov, ymov)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/100dots.png}
        \caption{100 dots game instance}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hspace{.05\linewidth}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}

        \caption{1000 dots game instance}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{Two game instances made with Pygame, with respectively 100 and 1000 dots that randomly move around}
    \Description{Graph shows two game instances with respectively 100 and 1000 little colored squares that, once fired up, move around by a random offset.}
    \label{fig:randomdots}
\end{figure}

Results, shown in the graph at figure \ref{fig:peval}, tell us us that: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing the number of dots from 100 to 1000 halves the FPS count;
    \item Adding a server in a separate thread halves performance;
    \item Using \textit{multiprocessing} yields worse performance than \textit{threading} in the 100-dots scenario (about -30\%), while performing similarly in the 1000-dots one.
\end{itemize}

This leads us to conclude that, for our specific purposes, the \textit{threading} module is the best choice, especially since the final game will be way less computationally expensive from a graphical standpoint, hence using a lighter weight alternative should be even more beneficial than tested.

All tests have been performed with the following machine: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item OS: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS x86\_64;
    \item Kernel: 6.8.0-52-generic;
    \item Shell: bash 5.2.21;
    \item CPU: 13th Gen Intel i7-13620H;
    \item GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU;
    \item Memory: 15610MiB;
    \item Python version: 3.12.3;
    \item Power Mode: Balanced;
    \item Power Supply: 100W via type C.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Game Engines} \label{sec:pygame}

There are many ways to implement a graphical user interface: from clever shell tricks like htop \footnote{Htop is a cross-platform text-mode interactive process viewer: \url{https://htop.dev/}}, to full-fledged game engines like Unity \footnote{Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies: \url{https://unity.com/}} or Godot \footnote{Godot is a cross-platform open-source game engine: \url{https://godotengine.org/}} that often come with their own editor and a \textit{top-down} approach, meaning build the UI first and then go down to code as needed for scripting and refining.

Unfortunately, our needs are quite opposite: what we want is a code-only, mono-language framework that while slowing down game development should simplify merging Raft with it. The choice thus boiled down to two alternatives: tkinter and Pygame. 

\subsubsection{Comparison}

Let's list strengths and weaknesses of the two.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{tkinter:} 
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item \faThumbsUp[regular] Module of the standard library;
      \item \faThumbsUp[regular] Few lines of code to make simple UIs;
      \item \faThumbsDown\ Low flexibility;
      \item \faThumbsDown\ No game loop;
      \item \faThumbsDown\ Not a game engine;
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Pygame:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \faThumbsUp[regular] Extreme flexibility;
      \item \faThumbsUp[regular] Direct access to game loop;
      \item \faThumbsUp[regular] APIs to access many kinds of user inputs;
      \item \faThumbsDown\ Verbose to obtain simple UIs;
      \item \faThumbsDown\ Non-standard community-made framework.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

We ultimately decided to opt for Pygame for four reasons: it is extremely flexible, exposes many useful functions (for example to catch different user inputs), gives direct access to the game loop and it is a novel and fun framework that has never, to the best of our knowledge, been used in such a fashion.
