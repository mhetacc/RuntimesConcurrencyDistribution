\section{Raft}

In this section we are not going to present the Raft algorithm, since Ongaro and Ousterhout already did so in their excellent work "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm" \cite{raft}. Instead, we will discuss our interpretations of its concepts and intuitions that were necessary to adapt it to our own use case.

The algorithm uses three types of nodes, namely leader, follower and candidate, and revolves around three core functionalities: leader election, log replication and overwriting, and cluster membership change. Log compaction is also mentioned, while a byzantine fault tolerant variant is never explored by the original authors.

\subsection{Node Types}

There are three types of node, namely leader, follower and candidate. In this section we are going to show their characteristics and similarities.
